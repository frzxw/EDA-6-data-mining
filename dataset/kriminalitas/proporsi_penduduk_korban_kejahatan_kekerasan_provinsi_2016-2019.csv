Catatan,"<br /><ul><li>Sumber: Susenas.</li><li> Untuk Susenas  2018 pertanyaan kejahatan ditanyakan untuk time reference 1 Januari - 31 Desember 2017, sehingga indikator kejahatan merupakan kondisi tahun 2017. Sebelum 2018 Susenas pertanyaan melaporkan kepada Polisi  belum dipisah per jenis kejahatan, sehingga nilai indikator 2015 dan 2016 merupakan pelaporan kejahatan untuk semua jenis kejahatan. Namun untuk tahun 2017 yang bersumber dari Susenas 2018 indikatornya mencakup kejahatan kekerasan saja.				",<br /></li></ul><br />,,
